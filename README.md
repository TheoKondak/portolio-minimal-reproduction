### Summary

## I am working on my portfolio, which is in a **private repository**. 

The app is pretty straightforward. It displays some data fetched from Sanity.

## I use Sanity for hosting some data. 

Everything seems to work fine with Sanity. There was some strange behavior, where when running build it could not find `sanity` to import various methods, and had to use an alternative import. The solution I adopted was this [one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75175242/module-sanity-has-no-exported-member-defineconfig). 

## I use NextJs 13.1.6

Also, I used vite to create the app.

The folder structure of the `pages/` is:
- `api/`
  - `fetchData.ts`
- `_app.tsx`
- `index.tsx`


Everything works fine on local dev. 

It also successfully builds if i run `vercel build` for the first time. If I try to run build again, it gets stuck on `info - Creating an optimized production build ...` . If i delete `.next/` it runs again without being stuck.

When I try to deploy though, I keep getting an error, and I can't figure out what to do. 


### Additional information

Here are the deployment logs running `vercel deploy` with no previous build or cache.

If I build locally and then try to `vercel --prebuilt` I get this error:
